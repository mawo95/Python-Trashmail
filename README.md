# Python-Trashmail
Python Trashmail Wrapper from futquest trashmail

# Installation

We currently don't have our lib on pip or yarn, so you need to download the trashmail.py from the github files manuelly or using git.
Add the file in your project or copy the class in the code (you dont need the import statement then obv).

# Requirements

You need the requests lib and the pre-installed threading and time lib.

# How to use?

```py
from trashmail import Trashmail

def new_email_callback(emails):
    print("New emails received:", emails)

mail = Trashmail()
print("Adress: " + mail.adress)
mail.onEmail(new_email_callback)
```

This is a simple example how to get an adress and log emails to it.

# Functions

You got a few functions you can use.
```py
getAdress() # returns the adress you are using

revokeAdress() # will clear the adress

renewAdress() # will give you a new adress and return the new adress

getInbox() # will return the current inbox of the adress

onEmail(callback) # will trigger the callback function every time you receive a new email
```


# Future

In future we will implement the option to choose own adresses and not get a random one.
